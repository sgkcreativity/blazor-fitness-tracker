üì¶ Deployment (GitHub Pages)

Workflow: .github/workflows/deploy.yml

On push to main, the app is published and deployed automatically.

SPA fallback is enabled via 404.html, so deep links like /workouts and /log work on refresh.

<base href> is adjusted during publish for https://sgkcreativity.github.io/blazor-fitness-tracker/.
